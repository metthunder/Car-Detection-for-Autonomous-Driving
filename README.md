# Car Detection for Autonomous Driving

This project focuses on detecting cars in images for autonomous driving applications using YOLO.  

## ðŸš— Project Features

- Detects cars in static images.
- Uses a deep learning-based object detection model.
- Displays bounding boxes around detected cars.

##  Repository Structure

- **requirements.txt** â€” Lists all the Python packages required.
- **Autonomous_Driving.ipynb** â€” Main notebook that loads the model, runs detection, and visualizes results.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metthunder/Car-Detection-for-Autonomous-Driving.git
cd Car-Detection-for-Autonomous-Driving
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Before running the .ipynb file, install all the required dependencies. By using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the Autonomous_Driving.ipynb file

```bash
jupyter notebook "Autonomous_Driving.ipynb"
```
